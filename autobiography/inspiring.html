<font face="Sitka Small" size="4"><p>We might know much things about Mahatma Gandhi, but do you know how this man became a soul, this journey in his own words seems to be the words of God himself. Once you read the book � � My experiment with truth by M.K. Gandhi�, you would realize that this is altogether new world, new learning, the new horizon, witnessing the unthinkable. He frankly admits and revealed that while his father was extremely ill and dying on the bed, he was so lustful that even then he was thinking about sexual intercourse. How this lustful MK Gandhi transformed into the person who retaliated the British cruelty in South Africa for a cause and how�he became a powerful source of energy for 32 crores Indian Population.
We only know his extraordinary ethics, values, and principles, we think of a man who must�ve been perfect, without any flaws! You would see in this book�that he had his own flaws and how his determination, discipline, routine and improving on small things overcame his flaws.This book shows that �winners are not born, they are made!�
Similarly, each and every biography would help you become more flexible, determined, visionary, inspirational and above all a great human being.
The beauty of reading a book is that you can imagine�the story in your own way of fascination. The reading book also helps us to become better human being and�smart person. If you still looking for more reasons to convince yourself, read this
Below mentioned list the result of my reading habit and the little bit of research, so don�t waste your time in verifying the details about these books. These books are :</p></font>

<td><font face="Sitka Small" size="4"><p>Though as above mentioned, I have already briefed few things about �My Experiment with truth� by Mahatma Gandhi himself.�He is at times brutally honest in describing his experiments and incidents.
This book is an invaluable insight into one of the 20th century�s most iconic characters for whom Albert Einstein once said that �Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. (said of Mahatma Gandhi)�.
If such are the words of the greatest ever scientist of the world, then what more you need to get excited to read this wonderful book.

� �I recommend this ultimate book to energize and rejuvenate yourself, as I think this book carries the part of himself � Swami�s power. Many have already got energized by just reading him. Remember his famous quote:� Arise, awake and stop not, till the goal is reached�. Since you have reached here, it means you have come here with the purpose. A man with a clear vision and mind, a brilliant speaker, clearly inspiring our lives. His superhuman accomplishments in the 1890�s America with unbelievable odds working against him. Yet what he did in 1893 in Chicago will be heard for centuries.
Apart from your own read, this is one of the finest biographies to gift your near and dear ones of all age group and this will surely help�students.</p></font>
